### Introduction

I want to start this review by saying that despite all the critism I'm going to present in the following paragraphs, Tears of the Kingdom is a really good game. I put 105 hours into it, and did enjoy my time inside of this iteration of Hyrule. However, I put over 250 hours into Breath of the Wild, and I want to discuss why, despite Nintendo spending 6 years to innovate upon the original, TotK managed to frustrate me beyond belief.

TotK is a direct sequel to BotW. It takes place in the same world as BotW, in the same timeline, roughly 2-3 years after the events of BotW. Considering that BotW's main draw is exploring the game's world, this presented an obvious developmental challenge for Nintendo: how could they make exploring the same world feel fresh? I'll discuss their solution in more detail, but it's important to keep that question in mind when thinking about the game, because I believe it was the main question Nintendo themselves were trying to answer when designing the systems of TotK.

### The Tutorial

It is only fitting to start my review where the game starts as well: the tutorial. (Well, technically, the game opens underneath Hyrule Castle as Link and Zelda were exploring where the Gloom was coming from, but that was just cutscene-ridden exposition and isn't worth talking about.) Breath of the Wild's tutorial was *phenomenal*: you awoke in a cave, where the game gave you the Sheikah Slate and taught you the game's breakout mechanic, that Link could climb anything (unless it's raining, of course). Link exits the cave, and with the music swelling to crescendo, the camera pans to the Kingdom of Hyrule and shows you everything that you can explore, and just...lets you. No handholding, and only a few minor cutscenes with the Old Man.

All the teaching in BotW's tutorial is done diegetically, rather than with obnoxious pop-ups. Peppers and cooking pots are placed near every entrance of the cold area; shrines, one of the game's core systems, teaches you the basics of the Sheikah Slate and the Runes. It doesn't make any decisions for the player, and lets them decide what they want to do instead. It allows the player to complete the requiremented segments in whatever order they so desire. It is the perfect video game equivalent of "show, don't tell". But most importantly, although you're confined to the Great Plateau, the gameplay loop of the tutorial is *identical* to that of the main game, while still managing to teach you all the mechanics it needs to -- you're still exploring the world, looking for Shrines, scavenging for weapons, fighting enemies.

Tears of the Kingdom's tutorial area is the Great Sky Island, and while at first glance it is structured very similar to the Great Plateau, the deeper you look, the more discrepancies you uncover. The important one to note is that while the Great Plateau doesn't make any decisions for you, and lets you tackle the objectives in any order you want to, the Great Sky Island only *pretends* like it gives you the freedom to explore whatever you want, in whatever order, when it actually is required to be explored in order. How? The Great Sky Island blocks progressing through it by including environmental obstacles/terrain that can only be overcome with the powers you get fromn the Shrines. For example, to get to one of the Shrines, you need to have Ascend already. This means that the Great Sky Island is designed to be played linearlly.

This has one big problem, however: sequence breaks. On my first playthrough, after leaving TotK's version of the Shrine of Resurrection, I was on the path to go unlock Rauru's hand -- which is the very first thing you're supposed to get, and all other possible progression towards completing the tutorial is blocked until you do -- when I turned onto a side path to explore a snowy mountain, because it looked interesting. Unbeknownst to me, this was a terrible mistake. I proceeded to play through the *entirety* of the tutorial, backwards. I passed literally all four of the Shrines, except they were deactivated because I hadn't gotten Rauru's hand yet. Because of the way the environmental progress gates were designed, they only worked from the front, and didn't inhibit my progress as I approached them from the back, until the *very last one*. I dropped down from a higher island to lower one, and in front of me was a huge lake I couldn't swim across. You were supposed to be able to use the Ultrahand to build a raft to cross the lake, but I didn't have Ultrahand yet. To get back up the previous island, I was supposed to use Ascend, except I also didn't have Ascend. In the first 3 hours of gameplay, I was softlocked, and had to restart the game.

Another problem, albeit minor compared to softlocking, is the use of Constructs to teach core mechanics rather than diegetically. Instead of showing us we can use peppers to cook heat-resistant food, there's a Construct that just tells you, and then gives you some peppers. After managing to perfectly internalize "show, don't tell" in BotW, Nintendo reverting to just telling for TotK. It slows down the pace of the tutorial and makes it feel like it's holding your hand far more than it ever did in BotW.

### Graphics

I don't have much to say in the way of graphics. TotK uses the same graphical engine as BotW. I believe there were minor improvements -- the Great Sky Island looks better than anything in BotW, for example, even though the frame rate was atrocious -- but, for the most part, the game looks identical to BotW. Without the HUD, screenshots of the two games side-by-side would be indistinguishable, graphically. BotW looked very good when it came out; Tears of the Kingdom, as a result, looks 6 years old. The game still looks fine, just dated.

I get why Nintendo did this, as TotK is meant to be a direct sequel, so it wouldn't make sense for the visual style to drastically change. Additionally, BotW was pushing the limits of the Switch's hardware even when it came out in 2017, barely managing a playable 720p30, and not leaving much room for TotK to introduce many graphical improvements, considering that both games are running on the same hardware.

The game's UI is also very similar. For some reason, in the pause menu, they used light gray icons on a white background that were impossible to see, and the "quick" menu to select a material is actually slower than the "slow" menu, but for the most part, the UI is fine.

Again, TotK looks decent enough. I still managed to get some beautiful screenshots, but the game's graphics didn't manage to take my breath away (pun intended) like they did when I played BotW for the first time.

### Story

One of the main criticisms of Breath of the Wild was the story, or lack thereof. Admittedly, there wasn't much of a story. The general gist is that Link wakes up 100 years after the destruction of Hyrule with his memories wiped. Zelda is in Hyrule Castle, holding back Calamity Ganon from oblitering the world, and while playing, you learn that Link and Zelda recruited four soldiers, called Champions, to pilot powerful Sheikah weapons called Divine Beasts. Ultimately, Zelda was unable to unlock the power inside of herself to seal away Ganon, and the gang fails. Link, badly wounded in battle, is sent to the Shrine of Resurrection to heal.

BotW's story exists solely to provide bare-minimum context for the state of Hyrule and a goal for the player to work towards. In the spirit of the game, BotW's story is told achronologically, with the events of the story being split in 16 "memories" that are each shown when the player finds a specific location in the world. This doesn't inhibit the story, however, because the player already knows the ending of the story from the very beginning of the playthrough: Link and Zelda lost; Hyrule is in ruin. The story is merely providing extra details, details which don't need to be told in order.

Hearing this criticism, Nintendo gave Tears of the Kingdom a proper story. While better than BotW's, TotK's story is still far from well-written or compelling. It mainly hinges on trying to figure out what happened to Princess Zelda, because she randomly disappeared in the game's introduction sequence. The story suffers even further from a very odd design choice: Nintendo decided to tell the story in the same way as BotW, tying the story beats to geographic locations. While this worked for BotW for the reasons I discussed above, because TotK has a proper story, it is designed to be told chronologically. Events later in the story hinge on earlier ones, and learning the end of the story ruins the beginning and middle.

Additionally, the characters will act confused about where Princess Zelda is until after you've learned the whole story -- which, if it was told chronologically would make sense because that's also when the *player* would know what happened to Zelda -- but since you can learn the end of the story before then, you already know what happend to her. There are some comedic side effects of the achronological story as well: all four of TotK's replacements for BotW's Champions (called the Sages) tell the exact same segment of the story, so you end up hearing it four times.

Despite TotK having an objectively better story, the achronological delivery hinders it so much that BotW's story is objectively more *successful* in providing exigency for the events of the game.

### Combat

Breath of the Wild's combat was far from perfect. One of the most controversial design choices was the introduction of breakable weapons, something never previously seen before in the Zelda franchise. In my opinion, BotW's combat is strongest in the first 20 or so hours of gameplay, when you don't have the weapons, armor, hearts, and food to brute-force an encounter. Instead, you're required to get crafty with your combat, using every available tool: rolling boulders down a hill to deal damage; sneaking up on a key enemy and killing it before they could react; picking up the dropped weapons of enemies in that encounter when you current ones break; using bombs to take out enemies from afar. 

Eventually, you get enough gear that you don't need to do any of that anymore. Nintendo was aware of this, and attempted to solve the problem by making enemies have more HP and deal more damage as the game progresses. However, this further isolates the early-game methods of combat -- as they don't scale in the way your other gear does, so they become even less effective -- as well as making any late-game combat encounter a repetitive and frustrating experience of repeatedly whacking a Silver enemy with your sword 50 times before its HP is finally depleted.

When coming to the table to design TotK, this problem must have been at the forefront of Nintendo's attention, because they came up with an absolutely *genius* solution: Fuse. You can take any of the hundreds of items in the game and fuse them to your weapons, increasing the damage and durability, and often adding special effects. This means that no matter what stage of the game you're in, it is always viable to Fuse a new, creative material to your weapon, because the damage of the creative combat solution scales based on the damage of the base weapon. Additionally, because Fuse overall increases the power of the weapons in the game, Nintendo reduced the damage of nearly all weapons compared to BotW, making the two games be of similar difficulty.

A slight complaint about Fuse is how tedious it can be to use. You can only Fuse items to your sword if they exist in the game world, rather than through the menu, so you have to go into the menu, drop the item, and then Fuse it. However, this is minor enough relative to the positives of Fuse that I can pardon Nintendo.

Bullet Time is also improved from TotK to BotW. In BotW, pulling out your bow out in midair would slow the game down and immediately start draining your stamina similar to sprinting. In TotK, pulling out your bow still slows down time, but instead removes a chunk of your stamina when you fire the arrow. It is a small change, not needed, but very welcome.

Unfortunately, despite Fuse being a genius solution to BotW's weapons problems, the same cannot be said for its healing system. BotW uses a cooking system to handle healing, which suffers a very similar fate to the weapons of that game: while it is initially fun to experiment with ingredients to see what you can cook and carefully using resources to prepare the correct meals for a battle, it very quickly devolves in tediously navigating through menus to cook 20 of the best possible meal you can. Tears of the Kingdom does not iterate on this system *at all*. There are new ingredients and recipes, but otherwise, the cooking system is identical. It does not fix the other problem of cooking, which is that it is literally impossible to die in either game if you have enough food: you just pause the game (which breaks the flow of combat) and eat food until you're full on HP.

Additionally, Nintendo make one of the single-most mind-boggling design choices in their history: enemies can no longer one-shot Link if he was on full HP. If they were doing enough damage that they would've killed you in one hit, Link's health is instead set to 1/4th a heart. I do not know which problem in BotW that Nintendo was trying to solve by introducing this mechanic, as getting killed in one hit is totally okay from a game-design standpoint. That being said, it did *introduce* two major design flaws:

1. Link's effective HP (how much damage he actually takes from an attack) *decreases* as his max HP increases. For example, suppose an enemy does 10 hearts of damage. If Link has 3 hearts, one attack from this enemy will do 2.75 damage. If Link has 5 hearts, one attack will do 4.75 damage. If Link has 10 hearts, one attack will do 9.75 damage. When he has lower hearts, he takes less damage, which means he has a higher effective HP. **Increasing your HP in TotK decreases the total amount of damage you can recieve**.
2. It takes less food to get him back to one-shot protection. With the same enemy, if Link is on 1/4th heart with 3 max HP, he only needs to eat 2.75 hearts of food to get back to being able to survive a 10-heart attack. On 5 hearts, he needs to eat 4.75 hearts of food to be able to survive a 10-heart attack -- and then he just takes more damage than 3-heart Link anyways!

In TotK, it is more efficient to have *fewer* hearts. There is no trade off of maxing stamina versus maxing hearts; it actively harms you to increase your maximum HP. TotK's one-shot protection is one of the worst systems in the entire game, and it wasn't even present in the prequel.

### Exploration

Tears of the Kingdom reuses the same geography from Breath of the Wild, one of whose main draws was exploring that geography. Having already played through BotW, it is impossible to have the same of experience of discovery when playing TotK. The game's design philosphy reflects this: TotK is mainly centered around figuring out what *changed* from BotW's version of Hyrule.

In practice, this means that it is much easier to traverse the map in TotK compared to BotW. Insteado of climbing mountains, the game gives you the power to Ascend right to the top of them. The Towers, already very strong in BotW as a vantage point and way to glide to an interesting POI, were superbuffed in TotK; they allow you to glide to entire other regions of the map, provided you have the stamina (which, considering the detriments of spending your Light of Blessings on Heart Containers, you definitely should). Additionally, you can build Zonai devices to travel on the ground faster than BotW.

Personally, I didn't connect with the building system. It is undoubtedly a technical marvel; it is absurdly polished and miraculously bug-free, and for that, I must commend Nintendo. However, where as some people loved experimenting and creating in TotK, I had no drive to do so and only build Zonai devices when the game required it. The controls, while probably the best Nintendo could do, are still clunky and slow. Autobuilder, designed to remedy this problem, is equally difficult to use. I didn't find a need to build a device to explore the world, when gliding is easier and better.

One of my favorite moments in Breath of the Wild was climbing my way up this tall hill in the southeastern portion of the map, at the crack of dawn. I had noticed a herd of horses at the top of the hill, and wanted to tame one of them. As I crested the hill, I looked down the cliffside and saw Lurelin Village for the first time, the sun rising over the water. It was utterly magical. 

Because I already knew where Lurelin Village was when playing TotK, however, I could never have this experience. In TotK, because of the ease of traversing, when I decided I wanted to get to Lurelin Village, I could just fly to exactly where I knew it was. There was no riding my horse through roofed forests and gorgeous fields based on the directions given to me at a stable. There was no climbing up a mountain with no idea of what would encounter me at the top.

The main loop of finding out what has changed from BotW, in my subjectively objective opinion, is less satisfying than exploring the world for the first time.

### The Sky Islands and the Depths

This is Nintendo's solution to the exploration problem I described above. Unfortunately, neither of them succeed.

The Depths' biggest problem is how little content there is. The Depths are a barren wasteland, with ~90% of the space being empty that boring to explore after about fifteen minutes. The entire Depths looks the exact same, which looks boring and uninspired even when you are exploring them for the first time, and quickly becomes unbearably monotonous. The main POIs in the Depths are situated directly under the aboveground towns, and are significantly less fun to explore than said towns, mainly just being deserted mines with basically no content. 80% of the content is just fighting enemies, something you can do just fine aboveground without having to trek through mind-numbing negative space, with the other 20% being -- get this -- rematches against aboveground bosses.

Additionally, the Depths start out as being entirely pitch black, so you have to find all the Lightroots before you can even explore them. (The Lightroots are directly underneath each aboveground Shrine, which does make finding them tolerable, but it means that exploring the Depths turns into a beeline towards the next location of a Shrine where you don't have the corresponding Lightroot.) This means that before even finding the content in the Depths, you have to first run through the entire Depths in pitch blackness to light up the surrounding area. They are simply nowhere near as fun to explore as either game's aboveground map.

The Sky Islands, in contrast, were designed to pander to the fans of older Zelda games who wanted the more traditional feel. They are structured as archipelagos, with a clear and obvious goal at the end, such as a Shrine, where you can only progress linearally through the islands. They are both more visually interesting and have more varied gameplay than the Depths, but they are not a suitable replacement for playing through a truly linear Zelda title. There are a lot of filler islands, whereas every nook and cranny in the traditional games feels thought-out and intentional.

### Shrines

Whether or not you like the Shrines in this game comes entirely down to preference. Breath of the Wild's shrines are more like standard puzzles, where most of your time is spent figuring out *what* to do, rather than actually doing it. In contrast, the majority of TotK's Shrines are mostly tech demos for the game's physics engine/Ultrahand. This is not concrete; BotW has tech demo Shrines, and TotK has traditional puzzles, but it is a good general rule of thumb.

With over 100 Shrines in both games, there's bound to be filler. BotW has a few too many "Trial of Combat" Shrines; TotK, because it decided it didn't want to intrinsically teach its mechanics, like BotW did, has a few too many Shrines that teach super basic mechanics like swinging your sword, that take *way* too long because of all of the dialogue telling you to press Y.

One of the best parts of BotW was Eventide Island, and the Shrines in TotK that are mini-Eventide Islands with different terrains and weapon sets are some of the best in both games. They are a ton of fun to play through, and I must commend Nintendo for keeping of the best parts of BotW alive, in a unique and fresh form.

Although this is entirely subjective, I preferred the Shrines in BotW much more. I completed all 132 Shrines in that game; however, I can not tell you how many shrines are in TotK, because after ~40 of them, I stopped doing them and just activated them for the waypoints. (Upon Googling, there's 152.) Especially after completing over 100 Shrines in BotW, and not really connecting with the main mechanic used in TotK's ones, I simply didn't have any interest in completing them.

### The Temples

The Temples, while a step up from BotW's Divine Beasts, are still a far cry from a traditional Zelda game's dungeons. They follow the exact same design as BotW's Divine Beasts: go to the five terminals, in any order, solve the puzzle to open the door each terminal, then return to the center of the dungeon and fight a boss. The main difference between BotW and TotK's dungeons are that the Temples have better theming and unique bossfights, rather than the Divine Beast's identical theming and rehashed bosses.

The Lightning Temple was my favorite. The atmosphere was the best out of the dungeons, with the tight corridors, limestone construction, secret passages, mummy enemies, and tombs. None of the puzzles in any of the dungeons are exceptional, but I found the light beam puzzles in this Temple to be some of the most memorable in the game. The bossfight is mediocre, but to be honest, all of them are.

Both the Water and Wind Temples are fine, but very forgettable. Forgettable puzzles, forgettable design, forgettable bosses. They serve as decent climaxes to their respectable questline, but they are far from memorable. The *buildup* to the Wind Temple is great -- I really enjoyed the whole Rito Regional Phenomina questline -- but the Temple itself is meh.

The Spirt Temple, the secret fifth temple, is about the same quality as the Water and Wind Temples. However, because you've already done four of them already, it is significantly less fun. Additionally, and while this is minor, it is an frustrating change: you have to physically bring the terminals to the central area, rather than just activating them. It just adds a ton of unnecessary tedium to the whole Temple.

The Fire Temple can go fuck itself. I would take a Divine Beast over the Fire Temple. It was dark, confusingly laid out, and designed to be navigated with a railroad system that would give Sandy a panic attack. Nearly all of the puzzles revolved around a) getting to the top of the dungeon, or b) creating tiles out of using a fire hydrant on lava. None of them were fun, you either had to pull your hair out navigating the minecarts or tediously clamber up the walls, and all in all was not fun.

TotK's dungeons, while mostly better than their previous iterations, definitely leave room for improvement compared to the older Zelda titles.

### Sage Abilities

The Champion's abilities in BotW were overpowered, there is no doubt about this. Urbosa's Fury would instantly kill any minor enemy in a huge radius around you; Revali's Gale gave a huge amount of vertical height, letting you scale a mountain instantly or get access to bullet time; Daruk's Protection gave you three free perfect parries; and Mipha's Grace gave you a full second life. Nintendo decided the Champion's abilities made BotW too easy, and reworked them in the form of Sage abilties.

Rather than being activated by pressing down a button, you instead activate the Sage abilities by interacting with the Sage's Vow, which is an AI that runs around aimless. These Sage's Vows are incredibly annoying. They are constantly blocking the camera and getting your way, they do absolutely nothing in combat, they're just absolute hindrances. It is so hard to activate the ability you want, because they are constantly running all over the place and it is very easy to interact with the wrong one. They are so obnoxious, I spent the entire game with Tulin as the only one not disabled.

Revali's Gale was replaced with Tulin's gust ability. As Ascend, the Hylian Pinecone Trick (if you light one on fire, it gives you effectively a Revali's Gale), and the general ease of travel in TotK's would make Revali's Gale mostly obsolete. Tulin's gust is actually very useful, propelling you forward, meaning you can get more gliding distance with less stamina and height. It is the only Champion ability I had out, partially because it is the only one that can be activated without physically walking up to Tulin and talking to him: any time while gliding, pressing A will activate the ability.

Urbosa's Fury was replaced with Riju's lightning strike. If you interact with her, and then wait 5 seconds, the next arrow you shoot will have a lightning strike. Just use regular lightning arrows, there's no point to wait for her to charge up.

Mipha's Grace was replaced with Sidon's water bubble ability, and Daruk's Protection was replaced with Yunobo's cannon ability. I'm going to be honest: I don't really know what these abilities do, outside of solve the puzzles they were intended to solve. They're really lame. There's basically no point for them to be in the game, and that's why I had them disabled.

If all four Sage's abilities could be activated *without* having to interact with the physical Sage, they would have been so much more tolerable. As it stands, trying to use more than Sage at once is so frustrating that it is just not worth it.

### Conclusion

Tears of the Kingdom, is, in *almost* every way (looking at you, one-shot protection) an objectively better game than Breath of the Wild. If you play through TotK without having played its prequel, you will probably think it is the best game ever. However, Tears of the Kingdom just does not iterate enough on BotW to justify its **six year** development time. The game feels like it could've been made in a third of the time. It is so disappointing how long we waited compared to how much new content we got.
